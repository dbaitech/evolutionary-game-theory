    "# Replicator Equation\n",
    "The replicator equation was the first, simple description of the rate of change of the evolution of players.\n",
    "Before looking at the formula, there are the following variables to keep in mind:\n",
    "- $\\textbf{x} = [x_1, ..., x_n]^T$ is the current population state. Each element $x_i$ is the proportion of the population that is of a certain species or displays certain phenotypes. Each species will be termed as a player. For example, $x = [0.6, 0.4]$ means that 60\\% of the population is of species 1 and 40\\% is of species 2 (or player 1 makes up 60\\% and player 2 makes up 40%)\n",
    "- $W$ is the expected payoff matrix where each entry $W_{i,j}$ represents the payoff for a certain strategy $S_i$ when interacting with strategy $S_j$. Stratgy $S_i$ corresponds to player $i$'s choice and contains the payoff for all players due to that choice\n",
    "    - So, $W\\textbf{x}$ calculates the payoff for all players and strategies. $(W\\textbf{x})_i$ gives the expected payoff for a certain strategy $S_i$ used by player $i$ given that the population is distributed as $\\textbf{x}$\n",
    "- $\\textbf{x}^TW\\textbf{x}$ calculates the average weighted payoff for any random player in the population. It multiplies the payoff $(W\\textbf{x})_i$ for each strategy $S_i$ by the proportion of how much it is used in the population $x_i$ (equivalent to the weighting of player $i$ - its proportion of the population).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to determine how the proportion of a population for a player $i$ would change according to its strategy $S_i$, we calculate the deviation of the payoff for following strategy $S_i$ from the average payoff in the population:\n",
    "$$(W\\textbf{x})_i - \\textbf{x}^TW\\textbf{x}$$\n",
    "If $(W\\textbf{x})_i > \\textbf{x}^TW\\textbf{x}$, then that means that strategy $S_i$ is more fit than average and benefited player $i$ and increased its proportion $x_i$ in the population. Vice versa for $(W\\textbf{x})_i < \\textbf{x}^TW\\textbf{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we multiply this by player $i$'s current proportion of the population (expressed by $x_i$ to get the final replicator equation:\n",
    "$$\\dot{x_i} = x_i[(W\\textbf{x})_i - \\textbf{x}^TW\\textbf{x}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We now implement a small example of this."
